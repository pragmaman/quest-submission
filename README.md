## chapter 1 day 1


  HERE ARE SOME ANSWERS
  ###<1> BLOCKCHAIN is like internet when it was launched in 90s its a generational technology it can change the way the system works curently that too without any middleman without any authority without any trustworthy ...
  blockchain has certainly ita features such as open decentralised public ledger(database)
  is open means any person can interact like no matter whether that person is educate or illiterate and rich or poor irrrespective of social status 
  decentralised means nobody holds or control the blockchain
  public means anyone can view the data or within it but cannot modify it 
  ledger(database) means since its open source anyone can store data 
  
  ####<2> smart conntract is a piece of code which the author or whoever wriiten it the code smart contract can not act itself one need to tell what to do how to do when to do all that stuff it can not decide itself it is just like robot which just follows the order smart contracts can not be modified once it uploaded to the mainnet after that one can interact with it but cant modify it
  
   #####<3> in cadence programming language to interct with code thers only two ways to do that, that is TRANSACTION & SCRIPT
   transaction requires gas eg to mint nfts to transfer asset trtansaction is rrequired transaction is not free of cost and transaction can change the data
    script is not required any gas it is free of cost it just view the contrct does not modify it hence it is free 


####CHAPTER 1 DAY 2
<1> saftety & security -> cadence maximises the saftey and security  by way of making itself resource oriented programming language, it has diffrentiated from contract and transaction and also scripts the assets witch owner holds like nfts it stored into owners account not in contract
clarity -> cadence is easy to learn Code should be easy to read, especially Smart Contract code so that we, as users, can verify it is safe. This is achieved by making the code declarative and allowing the developer to express their intentions directly. Cadence makes those intentions very clear by design, which, along with readability, make auditing and reviewing more efficient.
Approachability -> The way Cadence is written is very familiar to other programming languages, making it easy to transition to if you have prior experience.
Developer Experience -> The developer should be able to debug in an easy manner, understand what does where, and not feel frustrated. Cadence does this by making error messages very clear.
Resource Oriented Programming ->This is by far the most important, and will take up about 80% of our time in this course. Cadence at its core uses things called Resources, and they define pretty much everything we do on Flow. I will not get into this now, because we will have an entire lesson on Resources at some point.
