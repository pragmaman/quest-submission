  ###<1> BLOCKCHAIN is like internet when it was launched in 90s its a generational technology it can change the way the system works curently that too without any middleman without any authority without any trustworthy ...
  blockchain has certainly ita features such as open decentralised public ledger(database)
  is open means any person can interact like no matter whether that person is educate or illiterate and rich or poor irrrespective of social status 
  decentralised means nobody holds or control the blockchain
  public means anyone can view the data or within it but cannot modify it 
  ledger(database) means since its open source anyone can store data 
  
  ####<2> smart conntract is a piece of code which the author or whoever wriiten it the code smart contract can not act itself one need to tell what to do how to do when to do all that stuff it can not decide itself it is just like robot which just follows the order smart contracts can not be modified once it uploaded to the mainnet after that one can interact with it but cant modify it
  
  
  #####<3> in cadence programming language to interct with code thers only two ways to do that, that is TRANSACTION & SCRIPT
